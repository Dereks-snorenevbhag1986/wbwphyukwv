Dude, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 A Minecraft Movie, and I'm like, half impressed, half confused, you know? 😂 They actually nailed the vibe, but then some parts were like, wait, what? Why is Steve suddenly an expert at redstone when last scene he couldn't even craft a table? Classic   stuff, I guess.

Seriously though, the graphics were sick. Felt like jumping into the game but with a storyline that sorta made sense? I dunno, it had its moments. Also, the creepers just randomly showing up were kinda hilarious, less “boom,” more like “oops, there it is again.” 

> Bro, I have to say, 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   was probs the best decision of the night. Totally one of those “worth staying up late” kinda things. But why was the end so... overdramatic? The dragon fight was like, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 someone PvP on a laggy server. But props to them for not making it all super cringe. 

Anyway, I can’t even decide if I loved it or just liked it. The characters were like, all over the place, yet somehow it worked? And that soundtrack tho?! Got a bit repetitive but hey, caught myself tapping along. Oh, and do you remember why Alex sounded like a Shakespearean narrator? 😂 So extra.

Let’s definitely get everyone to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   together next time. Could be fun to mock it and cheer the dumb awesome parts out loud. We should totally do that soon, just need a plan or whatever.

var codex = weird addition to the chat;

Alright, man, I’m outta here. Desperately need some sleep but can't stop thinking why they added that weird dance-off in the village. Hit me up tomorrow, we'll more than likely laugh about this again. Peace!
